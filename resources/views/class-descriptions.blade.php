    <p>
        Our Ages 2-3 Boogie Babies program is a creative movement/ballet program. Our experienced adult teachers understand that our youngest dancers require the utmost care. That is why we pull out all the stops for our 2-3 year olds. We have put together a class format that is the perfect balance of structure and free expression. We use scarves, instruments, bean bags, hula hoops, ribbons and song and dance to teach dance basics and foundations. Our Boogie Babies program develops coordination, musical awareness, and listening skills as well as confidence, poise and discipline. All while they are having fun and socializing with other children their age!

Each month is focused on a different theme but follows the same structure so the dancers can count on the continuity and flow of the class which helps to build a trusting, safe environment. Our Boogie Babies program develops coordination, musical awareness, and listening skills as well as confidence, poise and discipline.

    <p>
        Your child’s safety is our priority! Our progressive acro program relies on a child’s own strength, flexibility, technique and training to execute the movements. Our tumbling classes are held on mats for safety but they we use the same floor we use for dance classes; it is resilient for joint safety but it does not provide any “rebound”. With a solid foundation of strength and flexibility our tumblers advance quickly and safely through our program, under the watchful eye of our professional adult instructor.
