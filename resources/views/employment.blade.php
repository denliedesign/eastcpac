        <p>
            East County Performing Arts Center is hiring for the 2020/2021 dance season and beyond with potential opportunities to shadow, train and teach this spring and summer. Our classes are taught by skilled teachers, in positive classrooms and we pride ourselves on age-appropriate movement and music.  Our dancers go beyond technique and poise to develop important life skills – learning to be respectful, confident and conscientious young people in the community.
            <br><br>
            You must have a high energy level to match our students, excellent presentation and professionalism, and a thorough knowledge of dance. We only hire career minded, long term employees who have stand out work ethic and desire to grow. We LOVE versatile teachers who are skilled in multiple styles and who enjoy teaching everyone – from tiny tots to advanced teenagers.
            <br><br>
            If you would like to join  the More Than Just Great Dancing® Movement on East County Performing Arts Center team send an introductory letter and resume to ecpacjobs@gmail.com.  No phone calls please.
