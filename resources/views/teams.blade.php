            <br><br>
            Our East County Performing Arts Center competition team is made of approximately 100 dancers between the ages of 5 and 18. At ECPAC we believe that competition team is more than just bringing home a trophy. We strive to build an environment where the dancers will learn about personal responsibility, teamwork and self-respect.
            <br><br>
            Not only do dancers get great training, access to master teachers, professional choreography and audition and performance opportunities but they are also expected and encouraged to attend college.
            <br><br>
            At ECPAC although we have a strict program and high expectations for our dancers, we are a family. We work hard together and we celebrate and have fun together!

            Some dancers will be asked to attend the next age group later in the day if the judges would like to see them dance with older dancers

        <p class="lead font-weight-bold mb-0" style="color: #12a9b0;">Answers to Common Questions</p>
        <p>
            <strong>What is Competition Team?</strong>
            <br>
            It is a chance for dancers to go to and compete in dance competitions. They compete against other dance studios in their age category and in dance categories, for example, 7-8 year old Jazz. All of the competitions we attend are within driving distance. Some competitions reward with trophies some with ribbons, some with cash.
            <br><br>
            Depending on how the dancers place, they can qualify to compete at a national competition. Many of the national competitions are held in Las Vegas and are always held in the summer. Some national competitions are televised. Competition Teams also have the opportunity to attend dance conventions.
            <br><br><strong>What is a Dance Convention</strong>
            <br>
            A dance convention is an all day workshop or weekend long event where dancers have the wonderful opportunity to take classes from professional and/or famous dancers and choreographers. The conventions usually begin Saturday morning with the first class at 8:00 am and end at about 3:00 pm. That is usually 6 classes with a couple of breaks. Usually there is a competition in the evening and usually lasts pretty late. Then there are more classes Sunday starting at 8:00 am until 3:00 or 4:00 pm.
            <br><br>
            During the convention, dancers have the opportunity to audition for scholarships to attend the convention for free the next year or various prizes that will continue their dance educationâ€¦so prizes conventions have awarded are music video shoots, meetings/auditions with talent agents, photo shoots, free classes at professional studios in LA and dance trips to New York City. It is an exhausting weekend but completely worth it.
